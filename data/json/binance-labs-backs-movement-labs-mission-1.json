Movement will use the funds to expand its suite of open-source tooling, frameworks, and protocols to facilitate the adoption of the Move programming language across broader blockchain ecosystems. With Movement, developers can launch secure, performant, and high-throughput Move VM rollups as easily as they do smart contracts.\n\nAs part of our global expansion strategy, we are placing a strong emphasis on the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, recognizing the immense potential and talent within the Move development community. We are committed to championing and supporting Asian Move developers, providing them with the resources, education, and opportunities needed to showcase their exceptional work and contribute to the growth of the Move ecosystem.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Binance Labs as an investor,” said Rushi Manche, Co-Founder of Movement Labs. “Their support and expertise will be invaluable as we continue to execute our ‘Move Everywhere’ strategy, starting with a focus on the vibrant and innovative APAC market.
