        "html": "*We saw that there are several questions regarding the protocol. Here are the answers for the some of the common questions that we received :)*\n\n**Q1: What is Stable Jack? **\n\nStable Jack is a volatility, yield, and points trading platform for any asset. Investors can purchase YT, or VT tokens to get leveraged exposure to yield, volatility, or points depending on their preference.\n\n**Q2: Which assets do you support?**\n\nCurrently, we only support $sAVAX, which is the liquid staking version of $AVAX. However, with v2, we will support any asset.\n\n**Q3: Which chain are you live on?**\n\nStable Jack is only live on Avalanche at the moment.\n\n**Q4: What is the mechanism behind Stable Jack?**\n\nStable Jack divides the collateral asset into two tokens, the Yield and Volatility Token. The yield of the collateral asset is directed to the YT, while the volatility of the collateral asset is directed to the VT token.\n\n**Q5: Why I\u2019m getting less reward than what is shown on the Rebalance Pool?**\n\nThe change in the sAVAX/AVAX exchange rate isn\u2019t exactly consistent over a short period but is in fact consistent over a long period. Thus, there may be fluctuations in short-term return but it is consistent in the long term.\n\n**Q6: What are some formulas that I should be aware of?**\n\n- **VT Token Leverage: **Total Value of Collateral Asset in the protocol/Total Market Cap of VT\n- **VT Price:** (Total Value of Collateral Asset in the protocol - YT Market Cap) / Amount of VT in circulation\n- **YT Price:** If CR>100, then YT is $1, if CR<100, then YT = Total Value of Collateral Asset in the protocol/Amount of YT in circulation\n- **YT CR: **(YT Market Cap/Total Value of Collateral in the protocol) * 100\n- **YT APR:** (Total Value of Collateral Asset in the protocol * Collateral Asset Yield/The value in Rebalance Pool) * 90%"
