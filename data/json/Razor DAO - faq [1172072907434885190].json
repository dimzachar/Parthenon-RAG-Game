It is awarded to users who have made active efforts in one way or another to support the project\u2019s development by using the platform or spreading the word. Until the next phase, it\u2019s really easy to get considering that everyone on this discord right now is \u201cearly\u201d. There are however no guaranteed ways to get it except by carrying out genuine actions towards our growth. We\u2019re always watching. \nThe other role @Day 1 OG is no longer available as it was only given to those who were on the discord within the first weeks of launch."

Write a well detailed thread about RazorDAO and RazorDex on Twitter and tag us (and Movement Labs. 100 likes and/or retweets unlocks a special perk).\n3. Genuinely talk to your friends about us. Don\u2019t do it as a \u201cfarming\u201d service but because you believe in what we\u2019re building. (I\u2019ve asked a lot of people who invited them and those people were rewarded.) It doesn\u2019t end with the @R-1 role. There are newer perks that will only be available to those who got the R-1 and remained active. Also, this won\u2019t happen most likely, but extended inactivity after getting the role might lead to loss of the role. It is highly unlikely however. We just ask that you remain active."
