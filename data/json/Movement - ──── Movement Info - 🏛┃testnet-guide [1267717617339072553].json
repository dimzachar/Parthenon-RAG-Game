With this program you can help us **test out and improve our testnet** as well as help us **build our community for the long-term**. With your efforts and skills at work, **your reputation will rise** and your questing and **contributions will be recognized in very meaningful ways** \ud83d\ude09\n\nLet's address the basics of Building The Parthenon \ud83e\udd1d \n\n\ud83d\udc49  **How do I earn recognition in Building The Parthenon?**\n- You earn **Resources** by completing Quests in each of the Guilds. More details about this coming soon!\n- Our partners have created lots of quests, but remember **you do NOT need to complete all of them** to receive Resources! (https://testnet.movementlabs.xyz/resources)\n- **SO, YOU ONLY HAVE TO COMPLETE 10% OF QUESTS IN ONE GUILD TO GAIN RECOGNITION **\n- If you want to earn more in any of the Guilds, you can complete 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 90% to earn recognition in our program!\n\n\ud83d\udc49  **What are the different Movement networks?**\n- Movement is a novel L2 featuring the MoveVM that is integrated with other modular components like Celesitia for DA and Etherum for settlement\n- One of our great strengths is the ability for projects written in Aptos Move, Sui Move, or Solidity/EVM to all run on Movement\n- We are slowing integrating these together, but they currently exist as three separate netorks:\n-- **The Movement Testnet (using Aptos Move)**\n-- **The MEVM (\"Move + EVM\") devnet**\n-- **The Sui Move devnet**\n- Using these three networks during Building The Parthenon allows you to use apps deployed on Movement from all three languages/virtual machines\n- But is does mean that you need to use an Aptos Move, Sui Move, or EVM wallet address depending on the network the app your'e playing with is deployed\n- That leads us to the issue of multiple wallets... \ud83d\udc47\n\n\ud83d\udc49  **Which wallets should I use for testnet apps?**\nBecause apps that use Aptos Move, Sui Move, and EVM are on our testnet, you will need to use different addresses and potentially different wallets when testing out apps.\n- Check out this explainer to guide your wallet setup: https://www.notion.so/movementlabs/Parthenon-Wallets-Explained-69e088835d584b569ba487aa0d7e1f82\n- Support for more wallets will be coming in Galxe and in the apps on our testnet this week to make life easier for you!\n\n\ud83d\udc49  **What are the Guilds?**\n- Learn more here https://movementlabs.notion.site/Welcome-to-the-Movement-Community-Program-98b9a1115b954e228b9907952ed04e5b\n- Lean more about the **Paths of the Guilds** here https://movementlabs.notion.site/The-Paths-Of-The-Guilds-d5c27f7a90e947ee9c1c3e04f8f80718"
