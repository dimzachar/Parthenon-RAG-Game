This hold is part of our Anti-Rug Pull measures.\n\nPurpose: This policy is intended to prevent rug pulls and ensure project creators are committed to their project's long-term success.\n\nUsage: Tokens held by the Foundation may be used for ecosystem development, community incentives, or other purposes aligned with supporting the project and ecosystem.\n\nRationale\n\n1. Preventing Rug Pulls: By holding 1% of the token supply, the Warpgate Foundation can act as a deterrent against malicious actors considering a rug pull. This holding provides a mechanism for intervention and support in cases where the project's direction or management decisions may harm the community or the project's sustainability.\n\n2. Aligning Interests: This policy ensures that the interests of the project creators, token holders, and the Warpgate Foundation are aligned towards long-term project success and sustainability. It demonstrates a commitment from the creators to the project and builds trust with investors and users.\n\n3. Supporting Ecosystem Growth: The held tokens enable the Foundation to directly support the project and broader ecosystem through development funds, liquidity provision, community incentives, or other mechanisms designed to foster growth and adoption.\n\n4. Transparency and Trust: By transparently holding a portion of the token supply, the Foundation promotes transparency and trust within the ecosystem. This practice encourages responsible project development and governance, contributing to a healthier blockchain environment.\n\n5. Adaptive Measures: The Foundation is committed to the adaptive use of held tokens to address emerging challenges and opportunities within the project and ecosystem. This flexible approach ensures that the Foundation can effectively support project needs and ecosystem health over time.\n\nPrevious\nBadging System\nNext\nInter-Game Exchange on WarpGate\n\nLast updated 5 months ago"

The ranking scores achieved during these gaming sessions play a pivotal role in determining the distribution of allocations.\n\nAuctioneer's Creative Control: Auctioneers wield creative control by selecting the game format and establishing rules for allocation distribution. Whether it's an equal share for qualifying players or varying allocation sizes based on game rank and score, the possibilities are as diverse as the games themselves.\n\nTwo Distinct Allocation Options: Participants in the WarpGate Playable Auctions have the flexibility to choose from two allocation options. The first option ensures an equal share for all participants who qualify through game play, fostering a sense of inclusivity. Alternatively, the second option introduces a dynamic element, with allocation sizes varying based on the rank and score achieved in the gaming sessions.\n\nPrevious\nHow to participate in Dutch Auction\nNext\nHow to participate in Playable Auction\n\nLast updated 8 months ago"

This price gradually descends in increments until a participant places a bid. The crucial twist lies in the fact that the first bid, assuming it meets or surpasses the reserve price, secures victory, eliminating the chaos of bidding wars.\n\nStrategic Price Descent: Unlike conventional auction models where prices start low and surge amidst fierce bidding competition, the Dutch Auction on WarpGate strategically starts with a high price. The deliberate, incremental reduction in price encourages participants to make timely bids, ensuring a more controlled and efficient auction process.\n\nBid Wisely, Win Definitively: The beauty of the WarpGate Dutch Auction lies in its simplicity. Participants need to strategically time their bids, aiming for the opportune moment when the price aligns with their valuation. The first bid meeting the reserve price marks the end of the auction, and the participant emerges victorious.\n\nAvoiding the Chaos of Bidding Wars: Bid with confidence, knowing that the Dutch Auction format on WarpGate eliminates the chaotic bidding wars often associated with traditional auction markets. The emphasis is on precision and strategic timing rather than relentless bidding competition.\n\nPrevious\nAuction fee structure\nNext\nHow to participate in Dutch Auction\n\nLast updated 8 months ago"
