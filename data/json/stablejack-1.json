This right is given to those who contributed to the protocol financially. This allows you to buy the token at a profit and you can either cash out or drive your gains more.\n\nTo be eligible for this right, the protocol expects certain actions to be taken by the user, including:\n\nLiquidity provision\n\nProduct usage\n\nReferral\n\nand many more which can be tailored based on the project’s needs.\n\nSome features of Discount Tickets models include:\n\nThe deadline for the campaign is pre-determined.\n\nThe total amount that is allocated as rewards is pre-determined.\n\nAn individual allocation will be determined by the percentage of one’s Discount Tickets compared to total Discount Tickets, while the discount will be determined according to one’s tier. A user’s tier will depend on the total amount of Discount Tickets the user has collected.\n\nTL;DR for how Discount Tickets Work:\n\nDo some actions that the protocol asks you to do.\n\nCollect points and claim your Discount Tickets.\n\nUse these Discount Tickets to buy the governance token at a discount.\n\nYou can hold it, or you can sell it. Either way, you are in profit.\n\nYou win, the protocol wins.\n\nWe believe that the loyal community members will be happy to bear the cost of the discount and receive an outsized reward since this will prevent sybils and mercenary capital from extracting value from the loyal community members.\n\nPrevious\nThe Death of Airdrops: Discount Tickets as a New Paradigm\nNext\nComparison: Discount Tickets vs Airdrops?"

In this sense, the Discount Ticket system will benefit long-term holders over mercenary capital and sybils. It is financially positive for the protocol and this means that incentive programs can continue longer which is a net positive for the users. In addition to this, unlike the airdrop system, it doesn’t create a selling pressure that puts the protocol’s future at risk.\n\nThe airdrop system was a successful method of rewarding early users in the early cycle of the crypto ecosystem. However, the market is over-saturated, and there are many protocols launching airdrop programs hoping it will attract liquidity, users and help them to find PMF. However, with recent airdrops, we have seen that this method is no longer sustainable and should be put to an end.\n\nStable Jack is here to innovate. We believe that the airdrop system is a rug game for retail and early contributors, and we won’t play that game.\n\nPrevious\nComparison: Discount Tickets vs Airdrops?"

If you provide liquidity to the protocol in any way, you will be receiving Discount Tickets like you earn points. These Discount Tickets will turn into Discount and Allocation based on your ranking in the leaderboard and your total contribution compared to the whole contribution of the participants.\n\nThe Discount Ticket model allows protocols to amass Protocol Owned Liquidity which can be used to boost the protocol and the token.\n\nThe Discount Ticket model can’t be overfarmed as it discourages the sybils and mercenary capital. This allows outstanding rewards for loyal contributors.\n\nThe Discount Ticket model has clear goals, reward allocation, and timeline compared to airdrops with no clarity.\n\nYes, it is not a regular airdrop. The ecosystem is full of protocols giving out airdrops to the community to reward early contributors to the protocol. Some of the examples are LayerZero, EigenLayer, Renzo, and Parcl. These examples have shown that the airdrop system is broken. A value (token) can’t be given for free, and if a protocol does so, it invites sybils and industrial farmers who are ready to dump all the tokens to the long-term holders and retail.\n\nAfter an airdrop campaign ends, mercenary capital and sybils leave, liquidity drains and the protocol is left with nothing. This means that the token will lose its value eventually, and it is a lose-lose situation for everyone involved, especially for those who are loyal supporters of the protocol, unless you are a whale who luckily dumped all your bags into the retail.\n\nTL;DR: Airdrops encourage sybils, mercenary capital, and users who don’t have long-term alignment, while the Discount Ticket system rewards loyal and long-term supporters by allowing them to invest in projects like VCs.\n\nPrevious\nThe Solution: Discount Tickets\nNext\nThe Case for Discount Tickets"

As some airdrops resulted in huge profits thanks to being under-farmed, this new trend attracted huge interest among CT. As a result, several protocols adopted this trend quickly.\n\nFor protocols, it is a good solution because it empowers protocols against users. It creates hype and speculation which surely attracts attention. In the end, founders can show VCs that they have traction and found PMF.\n\nFor sybils/mercenary capital, they can easily extract value and leave the protocol at the end.\n\nFor retail, it was good hopium because it offered hype and speculation, and the chance to get rich quickly. However, in the end, most farmers were farmed even though they took the risk of being early.\n\nWith the latest EigenLayer and LayerZero dramas, we saw that we are coming to the end of airdrops as there are several flaws in the existing models.\n\nWe want to give the power back to retail again…\n\n\nWhy is the airdrop model unsustainable?\n\nTo understand why the expectations are not met with the airdrops that are dependent on the points system, there are things we should consider:\n\nTotal fundraising is a major factor in determining the total allocation for the airdrop.\n\nFounders may not be willing to allocate a big portion of the token supply to the community.\n\nMost airdrops are overfarmed because they invite sybils and mercenary capital.\n\nThere is no deadline and the airdrop amount is not clear.\n\nThe protocols are keen to farm the farmers without launching the tokens as the fees are juicy and they do not need to distribute them.\n\nAirdrops are financially negative for the protocols as they bear significant costs by distributing their tokens for free.\n\nSo, the basic answer to your question: There are limited resources while the demand is infinite, and the airdrop game is arbitrarily rugged by teams and VCs.\n\nAs a result of this status quo, while the mercenary capitals/sybils and protocols benefit from airdrops, retail users who took the risk of being early are not rewarded properly.\n\nHowever, we find it necessary to highlight that the issues with airdrops are not caused by the points system, but rather by uncertainties and a lack of clarity in terms of the timeline and reward allocation of airdrops. Any solution that does not aim to solve these issues is going to fail in our opinion.\n\nPrevious\nContract Addresses\nNext\nThe Solution: Discount Tickets"

As a result, new stablecoin models are without hesitation called algorithmic stablecoins that are destined to depeg. We thought that there could be some questions among the community about the mechanics of aUSD which makes it different than UST.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explain why aUSD is very different than UST. By doing so, we will prove that aUSD has a strong peg mechanism that is superior to all existing models while generating an organic yield.\n\naUSD is based on an optimized CDP model while UST is an algorithmic stablecoin\n\naUSD does not depend on any algorithm like UST to maintain its peg. The best comparison for aUSD is Liquity, not UST. In traditional CDP models, users are expected to deposit something around $150 in order to borrow $100 of stablecoin, LUSD in Liquity’s case. The $50 that is not borrowed will act as a buffer in case of liquidation. At Stable Jack, we wanted to make this buffer liquid and for this reason, we tokenize it as xAVAX. In this sense, the only difference that Stable Jack has with Liquity is that Stable Jack tokenizes the “over-collateralized” part of the Liquity so that we make the CDP model more scalable in terms of protocol perspective while making the protocol capital efficient in terms of user perspective.\n\nNo endogenous collateral like LUNA for UST\n\nUST’s model requires users to put LUNA as collateral to mint and redeem UST. In this sense, LUNA was the endogenous collateral of UST, meaning it didn’t have any inherent value unlike being a collateral asset.\n\nHowever, Stable Jack accepts AVAX LSTs as collateral to mint and redeem aUSD. AVAX has proven itself as a solid token throughout the previous bear markets, unlike LUNA.\n\nNo protocol token is involved in any burning or minting mechanism unlike Terra's LUNA\n\nStable Jack’s protocol token, JACK, does not have any relation with regards to minting or burning aUSD, unlike LUNA which was used to mint or burn against UST. This increases the stability and security of the stablecoin by not being backed by unproven assets.\n\nStable Jack only uses AVAX LSTs to back aUSD which increases the security and stability of the aUSD.\n\nStable Jack offers real yield unlike LUNA\n\nThere is no Anchor or any other protocol behind that uses VC-raised money to provide fixed APR to UST stakers.\n\nStable Jack will provide significant real yield to aUSD depositors and the yield will be derived from the staking yields of Avalanche LSTs which represent real and solid yield. Given that the yield is neither artificial nor unsustainable, the yield mechanism will not put the protocol and the stablecoin in a distressed situation like Anchor’s case.\n\nProtocol assumes delta risk for aUSD unlike Terra's UST\n\nTerra has always assumed that 1 UST = $1 worth of LUNA. However, as a result of the death spiral that Terra has experienced, significant inflation of LUNA has caused investors to lose faith in both LUNA and UST. \n\nAlthough Stable Jack assumes that the delta of the aUSD is 0 and 1 aUSD = $1 worth of AVAX LSTs if the protocol becomes under-reserved for some reason so it is not possible to sustain the peg of aUSD, it starts to assume the delta risk of aUSD, meaning aUSD starts to float like sAVAX. This allows the protocol to prevent bank runs and socialize the possible losses. Unlike UST, since aUSD holdings are converted to AVAX, holders of aUSD aren’t at risk of losing all of their collateral.\n\nTLDR;\n\nUST was a marketing plan with an unsustainable incentive mechanism that was not meant to be this big. As the protocol mechanism was dependent on the users’ trust in the system, it could not maintain stability. \n\nHowever, aUSD is a totally different model that has no similarity with UST as its reserves always match the existing liability while also generating a real yield. There is no unsustainable incentive that can force the protocol to break apart.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nFAQ\nNext\nContract Addresses\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

The first product is called aUSD, a decentralized and fully-collateralized yield-bearing stablecoin. The second product is xAVAX, a volatile AVAX token. Users can supply USDT, USDC, AVAX, or sAVAX to mint either one (all deposits are zapped into xAVAX before deposit).\n\nCan I get sAVAX back out again?\n\nYes! Every aUSD or xAVAX token is instantly redeemable for sAVAX at any time, in the amount of its current NAV. \n\n What is NAV?\n\nNAV is net asset value. It’s the current value, as determined by the protocol, of xAVAX or aUSD. You can mint or redeem xAVAX or aUSD for their respective NAVs. The protocol always accepts aUSD at a $1 value.\n\n\nWhy would I want aUSD?\n\nNo exposure to counter-party risks: aUSD is a decentralized stablecoin that has no exposure to TradFi and is an Avalanche native stablecoin that is anchored by the AVAX economy.\n\nYield-bearing: aUSD is a yield-bearing stablecoin that can generate native LST yield for the depositors in the Rebalance Pool, which will range around 12-15%.\n\nPeg stability: Even if the protocol fails, aUSD will be pegged to AVAX so that users won’t lose their investments.\n\nNo borrowing cost: Compared to CDP models, users do not borrow stablecoin, so there is no borrowing cost.\n\nNo liquidation risk of the collateral: As the users do not open a collateralized debt position, there is no liquidation risk for the collateral.\n\nWhy would I want xAVAX?\n\nLeverage AVAX position: xAVAX typically offers leverage levels between 1 to 4 times under normal circumstances, and users can easily monitor the leverage ratio in real time.\n\nExtremely low liquidation risk: Traditional perpetual contracts carry inherent liquidation risks, however, the liquidation risk of xAVAX is almost impossible as the CR of the protocol has to be lower than 100%.\n\nNo funding cost: Traditional perpetual contracts can be costly, especially for long-term holders. In contrast, xAVAX has zero funding costs.\n\nBullish on AVAX: xAVAX is an appealing option for those with a bullish outlook on AVAX and seeking long-term exposure.\n\nDeFi compatibility: xAVAX is a DeFi-compatible product that can be used in DeFi activities to further benefit from the token such as LPing, yield farming, and being used as collateral.\n\nNot affected by short-term price volatility: Most of the time sudden liquidations happen due to market maker speculation of upside or downside wicks. However, this can’t happen in the case of xAVAX.\n\nWhat risks am I taking when I hold aUSD/xAVAX?\n\nApart from smart contract and oracle risk, which are common to nearly all DeFi protocols, the main risk for the protocol is an extreme outlier rapid AVAX price drop which is larger than the ability of the currently minted xAVAX to absorb. In that case, xAVAX price would go to zero (sort of like a liquidation) and aUSD would lose its stability, reverting to 1:1 AVAX price movements.\n\nThe protocol has extensive and thoughtful risk management systems to prevent this from happening.\n\nWhat’s the Rebalance Pool?\n\nThe Rebalance pool is a farming vault for aUSD that earns high yields sourced from the staking yields of the reserve. aUSD in this vault can be automatically redeemed into sAVAX if the amount of aUSD minted ever gets too high compared to xAVAX. When this operation is needed, the protocol redeems only as much aUSD as necessary to return the protocol to stability, with aUSD sourced proportionally from all depositors. Two important notes:\n\nNote 1: Until it is claimed, withdrawal-requested aUSD earns no yield but may still be used for redemptions\n\nNote 2: Users can deposit aUSD into the Rebalance Pool to earn high sAVAX yields and periodically DCA into sAVAX. \n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe protocol charges very small minting and redemption fees. Those can be avoided by swapping in and out on secondary and some fees are waived in certain circumstances.\n\nAside from that, users do not pay any cost. Protocol revenue and stability services come from staking yields earned by sAVAX in the reserve.\n\nIs aUSD an algorihtmic stablecoin?\n\nNot at all! We hate algorithmic stablecoins. We are building a new crypto-backed stablecoin that improves CDP models in 2 categories:\n\nA) Scalability of the protocol\nB) Capital efficiency for the user\n\nWe are not an algorithmic stablecoin like Luna's UST:\n\n1. There is no endogenous collateral like LUNA for UST\n2. No protocol token is involved in any burning or minting mechanism unlike Terra's LUNA\n3. We offer real yield with AVAX LSTs unlike LUNA\n4. The protocol assumes delta risk for aUSD unlike Terra's UST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nCalculations\nNext\nThe differences between aUSD and UST\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

This data shows that we can have consistent and sustainable real yield for the aUSD holders. It will range between 12-15%.\n\nOpen Interest-Long/Short Ratio/Funding Rate: This shows that there is a strong demand for long AVAX during every cycle of the market. Even though most think that people will be hesitant to long AVAX during the bear, this is not the case.\n\n\nxAVAX Leverage: Total Value of sAVAX in the protocol/Total Market Cap of xAVAX\n\nxAVAX Price: (Total Value of sAVAX in the protocol - aUSD Market Cap) / Amount of xAVAX in circulation\n\naUSD Price: If CR>100, then aUSD is $1, if CR<100, then aUSD = Total Value of sAVAX in the protocol/Amount of aUSD in circulation\n\naUSD CR: (aUSD Market Cap/Total Value of sAVAX in the protocol) * 100\n\naUSD APR: (Total Value of sAVAX in the protocol * sAVAX APR/The value in Rebalance Pool) * 90% \n\nThe change in the sAVAX/AVAX exchange rate isn’t exactly consistent over a short period but is in fact consistent over a long period.

In such a situation, aUSD would have sole claim on the reserve. If this occurs, the NAV of aUSD would no longer remain stable but would instead mirror the complete price fluctuations of AVAX. Nonetheless, aUSD would still be redeemable.\n\nWhat happens if sAVAX depegs from AVAX?\n\nThe protocol incorporates an automatic emergency mechanism designed to safeguard holders of aUSD and xAVAX in the event of a potential sAVAX depegging. Utilizing multiple oracle feeds, the protocol monitors whether the price of sAVAX has deviated by more than 1% from the price of AVAX. If such a deviation occurs, the minting and redemption functions are temporarily disabled\n\nOnce the sAVAX peg stabilizes, minting and redemption are reactivated.

Depositors in the pool earn a high yield, and if stability mode engages at any point, a portion of their aUSD will be redeemed for sAVAX. sAVAX redeemed from aUSD is owned by the Rebalancing Pool depositor.

If CR is below a certain threshold, the stability mode is activated to ensure:\n\neliminating the risk of xAVAX becomes 0\n\naUSD’s Δ=0 is maintained \n\nSelection of the threshold at which stability mode is engaged is based on the probability of a one-day price drop so severe as to push the system CR to 100% (i.e. xAVAX NAV to 0). The lower the CR of the system, the smaller the magnitude of the AVAX price drop required to trigger such an event, and therefore the higher the probability of experiencing one. \n\nAccording to Coingecko data between 2020-09-22 00:00:00 UTC and 2023-12-29 00:00:00 UTC, the probability of a one-day price drop to push the system CR to 100% is 0.0% if the protocol maintains a 160% ratio CR. This means there were no days until 2024 when the daily price drop of AVAX was 37.5% or more.\n\nAs a result, the protocol will maintain a 160% ratio CR to manage the protocol risk, thus, the risk management models are aiming to maintain this level. However, in the future, as the AVAX volatility decreases, the CR can be decreased.\n\nBased on our calculations, the possibility of such a price downturn is almost not possible:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fKvmTz3vYAQP35cH1Pa8dSUD1NCOTEIQO5vLijqiXHI/edit#gid=526713538\n\nHowever, the protocol will still take a cautionary approach and take necessary steps to ensure no risk emerges.\n\nPrevious\nMarket Analysis\nNext\nLevel 1 - Stability Mode Mint/Redeem Controls\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

By unlocking the locked ETH liquidity, LSTfi creates new financial tools that empower the ETH and Ethereum ecosystem. Even though the Ethereum LSTfi ecosystem is in its early phase, it has attracted many builders and investors to the ecosystem while also preserving the existing ones so that it can continue its dominance against L1s.\n\nMoreover, stablecoins are one of the most important product-market fits in the ecosystem. It is clear that stablecoins are adopted not just by degens but by daily users, so it can be assumed that for an L1 protocol to challenge Ethereum's dominance and become the main L1 protocol, it should have a solid stablecoin ecosystem. However, until now, the Avalanche ecosystem has not been able to lead or attract a major stablecoin liquidity in the chain. \n\nWith its innovative model, the Stable Jack can pioneer both the stablecoin and LSTfi revolution in the Avalanche ecosystem. While the protocol can bring stablecoin liquidity to the ecosystem, it can utilize AVAX LSTs so that it can open new opportunities for AVAX and AVAX LSTs which will in turn increase the demand for the Avalanche ecosystem\n\nConsidering that there is no competitor in both the stablecoin and LSTfi categories in the Avalanche ecosystem, we believe that Stable Jack can fill this gap in the market.\n\nCompetitors\n\nDAI - an over-collateralized CDP stablecoin with a $5.25b market cap.\n\nFRAX - a stablecoin that is collateralized with USDC with a $670m market cap.\n\nLUSD - a stablecoin backed by ETH with a $200m market cap.\n\neUSD - a stablecoin that is reserved by staked ETHs with a $115m market cap.\n\ncrvUSD - a CDP that employs the LLAMMA mechanism with a $150m market cap.\n\nfETH - a floating stablecoin that is decomposing ETH to issue a stablecoin with a $8m market cap.\n\nProblems in the stablecoin ecosystem\n\nCDP model stablecoins are not scalable as they require over-collateralization while carrying the liquidation risk, as a result, they are not capital-efficient.\n\nCDP stablecoins depend on the demand for CDP, not stablecoins.\n\nCDP models require high borrowing costs.\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins are vulnerable to censorship resistance and centralization risks.\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins do not share the inherent yield of USD.\n\nFiat-backed stablecoins are vulnerable to TradFi and macro risks.\n\nTotal Addressable Market\n\nBased on the data on December 26th, 2023:\n\nOn-chain demand for leveraged AVAX: $7M \n\nCEX demand for leveraged AVAX: $412M\n\nAccording to the statistics, we can say that the demand for leveraged AVAX is around $300M at this point, however, it can be assumed that as the AVAX market grows, the demand for leveraged AVAX as well. Moreover, considering that xAVAX provides a better solution compared to regular AVAX leverage in terms of no funding fees and unlikely liquidation risk, it can attract more capital.\n\nLeveraged AVAX demand is a great indicator of the scalability of Stable Jack, as the supply of aUSD depends on the supply of xAVAX.\n\nAn example:\n\nConsider that all the leveraged AVAX demand is realized via Stable Jack, in that scenario:\n\nxAVAX supply: $300M\naUSD supply: can reach up to $900M\n\nAs a result, Stable Jack can add a stablecoin supply of up to 3 times the leveraged AVAX demand to the Avalanche ecosystem without any costs.\n\nPrevious\nWhy should you use xAVAX?\nNext\nRisk Management"

The total aUSD supply represents the borrowed amount, and the xAVAX supply represents the difference between supplied collateral and the total borrowed amount.\n\nViewed through this lens, we can measure the health of the system in a similar way as a CDP, using the collateralization ratio. Another way to state that the system requires sufficient xAVAX supply is to say it requires a CR over 100% to function correctly.  \n\nThe CR is calculated as the value of the AVAX reserve divided by the value of the aUSD supply, multiplied by 100%.\n\nExample 1\n\nMetric\tValue\n\n\nAVAX price\n\n\t\n\n$20\n\n\n\n\nTotal reserve market cap\n\n\t\n\n200 AVAX - $40,000\n\n\n\n\naUSD market cap\n\n\t\n\n$28,000\n\n\n\n\nxAVAX market cap\n\n\t\n\n$12,000\n\n\n\n\nCR (Collateral Ratio)\n\n\t\n\n142.85%\n\nExample 2\n\nMetric\tValue\n\n\nAVAX price\n\n\t\n\n$20\n\n\n\n\nTotal reserve market cap\n\n\t\n\n200 AVAX - $40,000\n\n\n\n\naUSD market cap\n\n\t\n\n$22,000\n\n\n\n\nxAVAX market cap\n\n\t\n\n$18,000\n\n\n\n\nCR (Collateral Ratio)\n\n\t\n\n181.8%\n\nMinting aUSD or xAVAX, as well as adjusting the NAV of either token will have an impact on the CR.

The protocol has a risk management module that kicks in if the CR falls too low, to help ensure that does not happen.\n\nNote: As long as CR > 100%, aUSD can be kept to Δ=0.\n\nPrevious\naUSD and xAVAX\nNext\nUser Analysis\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

However, like any product, those yields are capped at some levels which limits the upside potential. By enabling users to exchange yield, volatility, and points, Stable Jack eliminates the problems that yield protocols like LRTs, LSTs, and lending markets suffer.\n\nProtocols that are integrated with Stable Jack can offer higher yields compared to their competitors, and create more use cases for their products. This will help them to attract new users, TVL, and help them to capture a significant share of the market.\n\nStable Jack's unique offering will allow integrated partners and Stable Jack to grow together. These partnerships will create new yield opportunities for users, and incentivize more people to use protocols that are integrated with Stable Jack. \n\nYield Token\n\nSuperior yields: Stable Jack offers a higher yield on any asset compared to any other protocol. This is achieved as it allows users to exchange yield and volatility.\n\nYields can be paid in any asset: Since Stable Jack can allow yield and volatility trading of any collateral asset, the yield will be paid in this collateral asset. This will allow yield products on commodities like BTC, gold, silver, or even an APPLE stock.\n\nCollateral asset: Since yield token holders maintain their principal, they can use it as collateral to short/long the yield, or borrow assets for daily purposes.\n\nNon-expirable: Unlike other products, the yield token of Stable Jack doesn't have a maturity date, this allows investors to have long-term strategies.\n\nPrincipal protection: Stable Jack enables yield token holders to maintain their principal, this significantly increases the capital efficiency for yield token holders.\n\nYield tokens will be attractive for conservative investors who want to get exposed to the leveraged yield of the collateral asset while still holding the collateral asset.\n\nLeverage Token\n\nLeveraged position on any asset: Stable Jack allows users to have a leveraged position on any asset with variable leverage. \n\nNo liquidation risk: Since the leverage positions aren't contracts but tokens on Stable Jack, liquidation is not possible.\n\nCollateral asset: Unlike exchanges, Stable Jack tokenizes the leveraged position, which enables leverage token users to use it as collateral to long/short the volatility or borrow assets for daily purposes.\n\nNon-expirable: Unlike TradFi, leverage tokens are perpetual, meaning they don't have a maturity date.\n\nNo duration mismatch risk: In TradFi, or even in crypto markets, the futures price of an asset might diverge with the spot underlying. Stable Jack is not vulnerable to this risk as the leveraged positions are not contracts but tokens.\n\nLeverage tokens will be attractive for users with risk appetite, or institutions looking to hedge their risks while still holding the collateral asset.\n\nPrevious\nHow to Determine the Leverage?\nNext\naUSD and xAVAX\n\nLast updated 3 months ago\n\nYield Token\nLeverage Token"

This connection is expressed through the equation:\n\nThe value of Collateral Asset in USD = (Total Supply of Yield Token × NAV of Yield Token) + (Total Supply of Volatile Token × NAV of Volatile Token), where the net asset value (NAV) is the current mint/redemption value of Yield Token or Volatile Token determined by the protocol.\n\nHere, the Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the current mint/redemption value of Yield Token or Volatile Token as determined by the protocol. The protocol maintains the stability of the Yield Token by consistently valuing it at $1, reflecting a fixed ratio of Δ=0 of the price of the collateral asset. Simultaneously, it adjusts the NAV of Volatile Token more significantly than the return of the collateral asset to uphold this invariant. This strategy enables Volatility Token to provide leveraged returns on the collateral asset without incurring funding costs, while Yield Token retains its peg to $1.\n\nIn other words, the total value of the collateral asset in the protocol = Total market cap of Yield Token + Total market cap of Volatile Token\n\nExample 1 \n\nUser A deposits $1000 worth of collateral assets and mints 1000 Yield Token\nUser B deposits $1000 worth of collateral assets and mints 1000 Volatile Token\nTotal Pool: $2000 worth of the collateral asset\n\nThe price of the collateral asset increases by 10%\nNew Total Pool: $2200 worth of collateral asset\n\nYield Token Worth: $1 (no price exposure)\n\nVolatile Token Worth: $1.2 (all price exposure)\n\nUser A redeems 1000 Yield Tokens and receives $1000 worth of collateral assets\nUser B redeems 1000 Volatile Tokens and receives $1200 worth of collateral assets\n\nNote 1: The price of the Volatile Token is initially $1, subject to change based on the price action of the collateral asset.\nNote 2: Even though the price of the collateral asset increased by 10%, Yield Token has no price exposure (Δ=0), while Volatile Token increased by 20% (Δ>1).\n\nExample 2\n\nUser A deposits $1000 worth of collateral assets and mints 1000 Yield Token\nUser B deposits $1000 worth of collateral assets and mints 1000 Volatile Token\nTotal Pool: $2000 worth of the collateral asset\n\nThe price of the collateral asset decreases by 10%\nNew Total Pool: $1800 worth of the collateral asset\n\nYield Token Worth: $1 (no price exposure)\n\nVolatile Token Worth: $0.8 (all price exposure)\n\nUser A redeems 1000 Yield Token and receives $1000 worth of collateral assets\nUser B redeems 1000 Volatile Token and receives $800 worth of collateral assets\n\nNote 1: The price of the Volatile Token is taken as 1$ because, at the genesis of the protocol, the price of theVolatile Token will be $1, but then it will change based on the price action of the collateral asset.\nNote 2: Even though the price of the collateral asset decreased by 10%, Yield Token has no price exposure as its Δ=0 while Volatile Token has decreased by 20% as its Δ>1.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nThe Mechanism Behind Stable Jack\nNext\nHow to Determine the Leverage?\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

These structured products can be used for any assets including;\n\nVolatile cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, or AVAX)\n\nYield-bearing tokens (stablecoins, LP tokens)\n\nBonds (T-bills, eurobond, corporate bonds)\n\nStocks (NVDA, AAPL, TESLA)\n\nCommodities (gold, silver, copper)\n\nStable Jack's smart contract divides the collateral assets into two tokens. These tokens are called Yield Token (senior tranche), and Volatility Token (junior tranche). While the users maintain their principal, the yield and volatility of this collateral asset are exchanged between two different tokens.\n\nYield Token holders get exposed to the yield of the collateral. Since they are also exposed to the yield of the collateral that Volatility Token holders deposited, they are able to get leveraged yield returns.\n\nVolatility Token holders get exposed to the volatility of the collateral. Since they are also exposed to the volatility of the collateral that Yield Token holders deposited, they are able to get leveraged returns.\n\n \n\nPrevious\nWhy Do the Markets Need Stable Jack?\nNext\nTechnical Explanation of the Mechanism\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

Yield products are only denominated in USD, or local currencies. Users can't access yield products denominated in cryptocurrencies, commodities, or stocks.\n\nLack of superior yields: In order to make DeFi attractive for institutions, and retail users, the yields should be increased. T-bill yields or interest rates on lending markets are not high enough for retail users to prefer such products. It is also not high enough for institutions to prefer DeFi over TradFi from a risk perspective.\n\nRisk of losing principal: Currently, users have to give up on their principal if they want to be exposed to yield products. This is a risky decision for users and creates a PvP environment for yield and volatility traders.\n\nDuration mismatch problem: In TradFi, the price of a future contract of an asset can diverge from its spot underlying, causing problems for investors. This might make such products risky and unattractive for investors.\n\nDerivative markets in TradFi has reached to $600T, while the interest rate derivatives has reached to $400T. This shows that in TradFi, there is a significant demand for products similar to what Stable Jack offers. On the other hand, the tokenization market is expected to reach $10T in 2030. \n\nCompared to TradFi, yield and volatility markets in DeFi are quite small. The value stands out at $11B, and Pendle comprises more than 50% of this market. The tokenization market stands at $4B, which is quite lower than the expectations.\n\nThis shows that there is a potential market with significant upside potential for Stable Jack as it offers a new yield and volatility product that is not available in the market.\n\nPrevious\nIntroduction to Stable Jack\nNext\nThe Mechanism Behind Stable Jack\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"

This will allow new DeFi primitives to be built on yield-bearing assets, lending markets, DEXs, or volatile assets.\n\nYield Token, which is tokenized as a stablecoin will accrue the leveraged yield/points of the collateral asset while Volatility Token will be exposed to the volatility of the collateral asset with leverage. Both tokens will be perpetual and won't have a maturity date.\n\n\nNext\nWhy Do the Markets Need Stable Jack?\n\nLast updated 3 months ago"
