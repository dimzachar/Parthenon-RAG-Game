After purchasing a Frenspass, users access a private channel with the Creator and other Frenspass holders. Fees for buying and selling Frenspass on MWFs include:\n\n5% of the transaction volume goes to the MWFs Treasury.\n\n5% of the transaction volume goes to the creator.\n\nHow Users Earn Money?\n\nBoth creators and supporters can earn on MWFs\n\nCreators receive a share of revenue when users buy and sell Frenspass.\n\nSupporters buy Frenspass and sell them at higher prices, sometimes using MEV bots to purchase early and profit from price increases.\n\nPotential airdrops from both MWFs and Movement, as suggested by the Points and Airdrop sections in the app.\n\nFrenspass Valuation\n\nFrenspass on MWFs are valued using a bonding curve. The formulae are:\n\nBuying Price of Frenspass (in MOVE) = N² / 8\nSelling Price of Frenspass (in MOVE) = (N-1)² / 8\n\nWhere:\n\nN is the total supply of Frenspass.\n\n8 is an expansion coefficient determined by MWFs.\n\nThe price is calculated in MOVE (assumed 1 MOVE ≈ 1 USD).\n\nThe price is proportional to the total supply. More Frenspass in circulation mean higher prices, creating a barrier for new users. Trades are made with the MWFs platform.\n\nTrading Profit Calculation\n\nTo calculate trading profit after adding k Frenspass:\n\nExample: KOL A has 100 Frenspass in circulation. The price for the next buyer is:\n\n100² / 8 = 1250 MOVE\n\nIf immediately sold, the price is:\n\n99² / 8 = 1225.125 MOVE\n\nIf the supply increases to 120, K = 20. The profit (excluding fees) is:\n\nk(2n + k) / 8 = 20(2 x 100 + 20) / 8 = 550 MOVE\n\nFor any N, users can calculate K needed for profitable trade (net profit > 0 after 10% fee):\n\nTrader profits when: K > N / 9\n\nFor N ≤ 9, K only needs to be 1 for profit. MEV sniper bots can make profits because they need only one subsequent buyer.\n\nSniper bot: an automated tool developed for quick trades based on market conditions.\n\nLarger N means higher K for profit after fees. Larger projects make it harder for traders to profit, benefiting the protocol and largest creators.\n\nTo find a KOL’s Frenspass total supply from price:\n\nSupply = Square root (price * 8)\n\nFor example, a Frenspass priced at 2.4256 MOVE has a supply of 14 Frenspass:\n\nSupply = Square root (2.4256 * 8)\n\nPrevious\nHow to Access Private Chat?\nNext\nBenefits of Private Chat\n\nLast updated 2 months ago\n\nHow Users Earn Money?\nFrenspass Valuation\nTrading Profit Calculation"
