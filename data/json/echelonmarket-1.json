APT collateral factor = 70% while USDC collateral factor = 80%. The account's borrowing power = 10k * 70% + 20k * 80% = 23k.\n\n- All asset price are quoted from Oracles\n\n\nLiquidators are encouraged to call liquidate to repay part of the liability and seize collateral at discount (close_factor determines the max one can repay, and liquidation_incentives determines the discount). \n\nGiven a vault could have M collateral assets and N liability assets, it is up to liquidators to decide what asset to repay and what asset to seize (M*N combinations). Hence the interface:\n\nCopy\npublic fun liquidate<CoinType>\n\n    liquidator: &signer,\n\n    borrower_addr: address,\n\n    borrow_market_obj: Object<Market>,\n\n    collateral_market_obj: Object<Market>,\n\n    repay_asset: Coin<CoinType>,\n\n    min_shares_out: u64) { ... }\n\n\nNote that min_shares_out is a liquidator-friendly check that guarantees the minimal shares to seize, which otherwise aborts the liqudation transaction.\n\nParameters and Data\nProtocol parameters\n\n- close factor: 50%\n\n- liquidation incentives: 107%\n\n- liquidation fee: 2.5%\n\nMarket addresses\n\n- zUSDT: 0x447b3b516546f28e8c4f6825a6287b09161659e7c500c599c29c28a8492844b8\n\n- zUSDC: 0xa9c51ca3bcd93978d0c4aada7c4cf47c0791caced3cdc4e15f2c8e0797d1f93c\n\n- MOD:  0xef2ae89796725d0eb363326ecb7df159feb949f6d1f400f76deeeebccbac00f1\n\n- THL:  0x127ea5b4c450be695e488da1c3bc013e2e93d8cf00270ef90385189844bc9755\n\n- APT:  0x761a97787fa8b3ae0cef91ebc2d96e56cc539df5bc88dadabee98ae00363a831\n\n- sthAPT: 0xed6bf9fe7e3f42c6831ffac91824a545c4b8bfcb40a59b3f4ccfe203cafb7f42\n\n- whUSDC:0xa76ebfb432982c864783fdb33cdf5a9edb18ac1b950deb8037f5cf8c984da3d2\n\n- zWETH: 0x548cf587bd918a0005b3372a1d23e64b18ace3c61962f087a21eac52cf228504\n\n- whWETH:0x114ee519ffa1e8697784bd1a350822cb37601a1476289051b8295165597a4538\n\n- CAKE:  0x41b039e5518b1a3786ee798d895e0ddf3141fbbc20009284323fa51ea279c819\n\n- stAPT: 0xc3c9cc885a52004e0490f6a8291b3bc5854f0e42d931fb124736bd189c9f0f45\n\nMarket parameters\n\nYou can check market-level parameters in the above address by looking into a Market resource.

You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Company Parties related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 13.\n\n14.           Limitation of Liability\n\n(i)             You agree that to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, in no event shall any Company Party be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Site, the Platform, Company Content or the Services.

You agree that if, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a Company Party is found to be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs, such Company Party’s liability shall in no event exceed the amount you paid to us hereunder during the 6-month period prior to the date on which such claim arose, if any.\n\n(ii)            This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.\n\n15.           Limitations as Allowed by Law\n\nSome states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by Applicable Laws.\n\n16.

Non-Waiver\n\nOur failure or delay in insisting upon or enforcing strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or rights. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, nor shall any waiver of any provision of this Agreement constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly made in writing by us.\n\n18.           Severability\n\nIn the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms and conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.\n\n19.           Governing Law and Jurisdiction\n\nThis Agreement is entered into in the British Virgin Islands and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: reliance on blockchain technology and blockchain technology service providers; digital asset transactions being irrevocable and losses occurring from such transactions; our use and reliance on proprietary data and intellectual property in its business; potential misuses of digital assets and malicious actors in the digital asset industry; digital assets potentially being subject to hold periods; developments and changes in laws and regulations; and disruptions to our technology network including computer systems, software and cloud data, or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment.

While Echelon is not directly responsible for the activity/liquidity of any specific pool, many considerations must  be addressed by it's core contributors before creating new markets\n\nFor V1, the following considerations apply to listed assets:\n\nEach new token adds a permanent, slight increase to transaction gas costs due to the added complexity in the smart contracts.\n\nIntroducing a new token as collateral elevates the protocol's insolvency risk. Tokens used as collateral are effectively the protocol's assets, and borrowed tokens represent its liabilities. Since borrows are primarily stablecoins and collateral is often in volatile assets, the following principles are key:\n\nOnly assets with strong risk profiles should be supported as collateral.\n\n\n\n\nV1's is designed to mitigate the insolvency risk when listing new, riskier tokens.\n\nCentralized assets as collateral introduce a centralization risk due to single points of failure that affect the Echelon protocol.\n\nAssets with potential oracle manipulation risks are restricted to single-asset borrowing to prevent multi-asset exposure.\n\n\nTokens that are enabled solely for supply and borrowing, not collateralization, present a lower risk. These tokens must always be significantly overcollateralized to ensure protocol solvency. For example, a user may supply MOD as collateral and borrow MOD backed by this collateral; however, assets not permitted as collateral must always be borrowed against less risky assets.\n\nDiverse liquidity sources mitigate risk through diversification.\n\nWhen onboarding a new token, it's crucial that the Echelon community conducts thorough analysis to ensure the asset introduces more value than risk. Only tokens with a substantial backing and a significant community presence should be considered. Our asset risk methodology provides a framework to evaluate tokens' risks to the protocol and calibrate parameters accordingly to manage those risks.\n\n\nManagement of New Market Listings\n\nThe introduction of new tokens into the Echelon ecosystem will initially be overseen by the Echelon core team. In the future, this responsibility will transition to the Asset Listing Governance Team, which will operate under the guidance and decisions of Echelon token holders. Further details on this process will be shared in due course.\n\nPrevious\nLiquidations\nNext\nOperational Security\n\nLast updated 4 months ago"

Liquidation Threshold\n\nEchelon determines the risk of a loan through the Liquidation Threshold, which is calculated by the weighted average of each collateral type against the total collateral. \n\nWhen the loan's value relative to the collateral exceeds this threshold, the loan is at risk of being liquidated to protect the protocol's financial health.\n\n2. Liquidation Penalty and Factor\n\nA Liquidation Penalty is incurred on the collateral's value during liquidation, serving as a fee for the liquidation process. The Liquidation Factor decides how much of this penalty is directed to the ecosystem's treasury, ensuring a balance between user protection and protocol sustainability.\n\n\n3. Health Factor\n\nThe Health Factor is a critical gauge of an account's risk, reflecting the proportion of collateral to borrowed assets. It accounts for market fluctuations and collateral performance. \n\nA Health Factor below 1 indicates that the account is under-collateralized, prompting potential liquidation to preserve the protocol's solvency.\n\n4. Reserve Factor\n\nAllocates a portion of protocol interest to the ecosystem treasury, calibrated based on asset risk.\n\n5. Collateral Usage\n\nCertain assets, like USDT and sUSD, are limited to Isolation Mode due to high centralization risks. In contrast, certain assets may, despite being decentralized, not be used as collateral due to limited testing and liquidity. Up to date information for a specific pool’s allowed criteria can be found on the Borrow page of the Echelon App.\n\nMarket risks directly influence risk parameters, with liquidity and volatility playing key roles.

In either scenario, the borrower lacks a financial incentive to repay their loan, as it would result in a loss, leading to bad debt.\n\nWhile Echelon/s liquidation framework aims to effectively repay vault loans in an effective manner, issues may arise during the liquidation process (high market volatility, slippage, gas costs, illiquidity, etc.) which may prevent the deposited collateral from being sold in a timely manner to make up for the borrowed amount, resulting in the protocol accruing bad debt. \n\nSo bad debt may be realized in \"black swan\" events.

To ensure proper liquidations and avoid any bad debt, Echelon relies on three major oracle sources:\n\nPyth\n\nSwitchboard\n\nCustom\n\nEchelon primarily uses Pyth oracle price feeds. For assets not supported by Pyth, the protocol uses Switchboard oracles to gather price data. In the event that these providers go down, Echelon will switch to a temporary fallback by performing a cron job that fetches prices from DEXs and CEXs to maintain system integrity.\n\nOne can view the oracle providers for each market in the prices tab.\n\nCustom Oracles for LSTs:\n\nEchelon allows for looping of LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), enabling a higher LTV (Loan-to-value) of 90% in eMode. To minimize risks, the price of LSTs is uniquely calculated through a combination of Pyth, TWAP oracles, and on-chain staking rewards calculation. For instance, the price of sthAPT for liquidation is calculated as follows:\n\nsthAPT = APT price [From Pyth] * thAPT/APT [TWAP oracle from Thalaswap] * sthAPT / thAPT [From Thala staking rate calculation]\n\nThe APT price comes from one of the safest and most advanced oracles, Pyth.\n\nThe thAPT/APT Pool (depest liquidity on Aptos).\n\nsthAPT is calculated as thAPT + staking rewards (on-chain calculations).\n\nThe TWAP (Time-weighted average prices) oracle from Thalaswap further smooths the price over a time interval, reducing the risk of sudden depegs (i.e., high price deviations over a very short interval). Overall, this can significantly reduce the risks of liquidation from LST depegs, while also mitigating any risks of protocol bad debt.\n\n\nPrevious\nSupported Assets\nNext\nIsolated Markets\n\nLast updated 4 months ago"

The model has two parts:\n\nBelow the optimal utilization rate (U_optimal), the rate increases gradually.\n\nBeyond U_optimal, the rate increases steeply to discourage high utilization.\n\nThe interest rate 𝑅𝑡​ follows the model:\n\nThe borrow rates rise gently with increased utilization but spikes when utilization approaches full capacity, to manage the liquidity effectively. Interest rate (IR) curves dictate supply and borrow rates based on an asset’s utilization rate. These rates are intended to maintain market equilibrium, while ensuring that lenders can access their liquidity should they wish to withdraw capital.\n\nModel Parameters:\n\nKey parameters for the variable interest rate model include:\n\nOptimal Utilization Rate (U_optimal)\n\nBase Variable Borrow Rate\n\nVariable Rate Slope 1 (before U_optimal)\n\nVariable Rate Slope 2 (after U_optimal)\n\nInterest rate slope change past U optimal\n\nTheoretically, if the optimal Utilization rate was set to 100%, the rates would follow a linear model. \n\nIt's essential to differentiate between assets primarily used as collateral, which require high liquidity for liquidation purposes, and those with ample liquidity on Echelon Markets, which contribute to a stable utilization rate. Market conditions also influence borrowing costs; Echelon's rates must remain competitive to prevent arbitrage opportunities.\n\nIn scenarios like liquidity mining, where borrow costs are influenced by external incentives, Echelon adapts its interest rates to balance the cost of borrowing with liquidity rewards. For the latest on deposit APY and borrowing costs, users should refer to the Echelon App interface for each asset.\n\nPrevious\nSupplying Assets\nNext\nSupply Rates\n\nLast updated 4 months ago"

A portion is set aside for the ecosystem reserve, as dictated by the reserve factor. This mechanism ensures that the yield generated from borrowed assets is equitably shared among all suppliers, contributing to the liquidity of the protocol.\n\nThe supply Annual Percentage Yield (APY) depends on several factors:\n\nUtilization ratio: The proportion of lent out assets to the total available supply. \n\nVariable rate: The interest rate applied to loans with rates that can fluctuate based on market conditions. \n\nReserve factor: The percentage of yield redirected to the protocol's liquidity reserve.\n\nSupply rates may also be subsidized by other token incentives on a pool by pool basis.

Pairs and Lending Mechanics\n\nIn each isolated market, users can borrow one type of token (Asset Token) by depositing another (Collateral Token).\n\nDepositing Asset Tokens in a pair gives lenders a claim that is redeemable for an increasing quantity of Asset Tokens as interest accrues.\n\nBorrowers deposit Collateral Tokens to gain the right to borrow Asset Tokens.\n\n2. Interest Rate Mechanics\n\nInterest is accrued continuously according to the formula: Pe^rt-e \n\nInterest rates are determined by a specific Rate Calculator contract for each pair. The Time-Weighted Variable Rate adjusts based on asset utilization - Rates decrease if utilization is low and increase if high.\n\nRead our Interest rate section for more information.\n\n3. Loan-To-Value (LTV)\n\nLTV represents the ratio of borrowed assets to deposited collateral. It changes with market rates and interest accrual.\n\nBorrowers must maintain their LTV below a pre-set Maximum LTV to avoid their position being marked unhealthy. To correct an unhealthy LTV, borrowers can add collateral or repay part of the loan.\n\nThe Maximum LTV is set for each individual asset pair. LTV information for the pairs supported at launch can be found under supported assets.\n\n4. Liquidations\n\nIf a borrower’s LTV exceeds the Maximum LTV, any user can liquidate the position by repaying some or all of the debt, receiving collateral plus a fixed liquidation fee in return. The liquidation fee, set at deployment, is usually 10%.\n\n5. Vault Account Mechanics\n\nThe Vault Account is a key element in the pair's accounting system, comprising two main components: the Account Value (total tokens within the vault) and a unique representation of ownership for each lender.\n\nThe Account Value reflects the overall holdings in the vault, including both the initial deposits and any accrued interest.\n\nLenders receive an increased value, symbolizing their contribution to the Vault Account. This can be redeemed in proportion to their share of the total Account Value at a later date.\n\nAs interest accrues within the pair, the Account Value increases, enhancing the redeemable value of each lender's token.\n\nPrevious\nBorrow/Lend\nNext\nBorrowing Assets\n\nLast updated 4 months ago\n\n1.
