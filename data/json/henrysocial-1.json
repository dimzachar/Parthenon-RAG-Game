This agreement affects your rights.\n\nHenry Social, Incorporated (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äù) makes available social networking programs (‚ÄúPrograms‚Äù) through www.henry.social and related mobile and software applications (‚ÄúCompany Properties‚Äù) under these Terms and Conditions.\n\nThis Agreement constitutes a legally binding agreement between each individual who enrolls in any of the Programs (‚ÄúMember‚Äù) or otherwise uses any one of the Company Properties. If you are a Member or use any of the Company Properties, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DISCONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN AND USE OF THE PROGRAM(S) AND TERMINATE YOUR PROGRAM ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY.\n\nYOU AGREE TO THE MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISIONS, DESCRIBED FULLY IN SECTION 4 BELOW, TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES WITH THE COMPANY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL-CLAIMS COURT IN THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 23.2.\n\n1. CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n1.1 Company may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove, or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Each such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to you. Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by website, email, regular mail, text message, in-app messaging, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed.\n\n1.2 Your continued use of the Company Property following any such notifications constitutes your acceptance of such modifications and your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, your sole remedy is to terminate your Account by accessing your Account‚Äôs Privacy Preferences. The most current version of these Terms and Conditions will be available on our website and supersedes previous versions.\n\n2. PROGRAM ACCOUNT\n\n2.1 To become a Member, you must be at least 18 years old and provide your email address and password for Company to create your Program account (‚ÄúAccount‚Äù). Each person is limited to one Account. To redeem certain offers and promotions and use services offered by our other Programs, you may elect to provide us additional information. Information that you submit through one of our Programs may be saved and available for your use in our other Programs, including, without limitation, any saved payment card information. Any and all information collected from you shall be subject to our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n3. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n3.1 We would like an opportunity to address your concerns without a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Company, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by submitting your request through our Member Services page. Please be sure to select ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something else‚Äù under Topics in your request. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you in writing via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission through this form, you or Company may bring a formal proceeding.\n\n4. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company‚Äôs business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company‚Äôs employees, agents, or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator‚Äôs decision is subject to limited review by courts.\n\n4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.\n\n4.3 CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person‚Äôs claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the ‚ÄúClass Action Waiver,‚Äù are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.\n\n4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS‚Äô Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (‚ÄúRules‚Äù). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.\n\n4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Henry Social, Inc., 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA, Attn: Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.\n\n4.6 This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Henry Social, Inc., 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or accessing a Company Property for the first time.\n\n4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.\n\n5. PROGRAM LICENSE\n\n5.1 Subject to this Agreement, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Company Properties for your personal use to access the Program(s). You agree that you obtain no rights other than the rights and licenses expressly granted in this Agreement. Company reserves the right to change, upgrade, or discontinue the Program, any Company Property, and any feature of the Program or the Company Properties, at any time, with or without notice. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by Company or its licensors.\n\n6. PROGRAM RESTRICTIONS\n\n6.1 You agree that you will not, and will not permit others to: (i) damage, interfere with or unreasonably overload the Company Properties; (ii) introduce into the Company Properties any code intended to disrupt the Program; (iii) alter or delete any information, data, text, links, images, software, chat, communications and other content available through the Company Properties (collectively, ‚ÄúContent‚Äù); (iv) access the Program or the Company Properties by expert system, electronic agent, ‚Äúbot‚Äù or other automated means or frame the program or the Company Properties within any applications; (v) use scripts or disguised redirects to derive financial benefit from Company; (vi) modify, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, decompile, copy or otherwise derive the source code of any Company Property for any reason; (vii) rent, sell or sublicense any of the Company Properties; (viii) provide any unauthorized third party with access to the Program; (ix) access or attempt to access confidential Content through the Company Properties or attempt to circumvent any security, Content protection, or authentication measure associated with the Company Properties; (x) interfere with the operation of the Program, including, but not limited to, distribution of unsolicited advertising or mail messages and propagation of computer worms and viruses; (xi) post any material in any form whatsoever on the Company Properties or within the Program that is defamatory, obscene or otherwise unlawful or violates any third party‚Äôs right of privacy or publicity; (xii) infringe any third party‚Äôs patent, copyright, service mark, trademark or other intellectual property right of any kind or misappropriate the trade secrets of any third party in connection with your use of the Program or the Company Properties; (xiii) engage in any activity that does not comply with applicable law and regulations or otherwise engage in any illegal, manipulative\n\nPrevious\nPrivacy Policy\n\nLast updated 3 months ago\n\n1.

Imagine a sprawling, ever-growing forest where each tree represents a network of opportunities, and each branch signifies a pathway to financial growth. This forest, our Social Trees, extends infinitely, providing boundless potential for users to cultivate and reap rewards.\n\nUnderstanding Social Trees\n\nSocial Trees is designed to function similarly to traditional multi-layered marketing systems but with a significant enhancement: it operates infinitely deep. Each participant in the Social Trees ecosystem can grow their network without limitations, fostering a dynamic and expansive community where opportunities for income generation are unlimited.\n\nThink of each participant as a seed planted in fertile soil. As they engage with our platform, they nurture their tree, which begins to sprout branches representing their direct referrals. Each branch then grows its own sub-branches, further extending the network. This process continues infinitely, with each new connection contributing to the overall strength and reach of the tree. Users are then actively rewarded for growing and nurturing their tree by getting a payout when users from their tree shop.\n\nSample Social Tree\nEarning Passive Income\n\nThe beauty of Social Trees lies in its ability to provide users with a robust passive income stream. As your tree expands, the cumulative efforts of your network generates continuous revenue. Here‚Äôs how it works:\n\nDirect Earnings: You earn commissions from the activities and transactions of your direct referrals.\n\nIndirect Earnings: As your referrals bring in new participants, you also earn a percentage of their activities, creating multiple layers of income.\n\nInfinite Depth: Unlike traditional models that cap earnings after a few layers, Social Trees allow you to benefit from every layer of growth, no matter how deep it goes. This means the earlier you participate in our network, the faster your social trees will grow and the more commissions you can earn!\n\nHow Can I Build My Social Trees?\n\nRefer users onto the Luxe Rewards platform through the ‚ÄúReferral‚Äù toggle on our web application using your referral code. If you are on mobile, you can also use your custom QR code to invite other users!\n\nAnybody who your referrals refer, will automatically be added to your Social Tree. This creates a chain effect, that can run infinite layers deep.\n\nWhen anybody within your social tree earns cryptoback, you receive cryptoback as well!\n\nIt's that simple. The more people you refer, the more exponentially your earnings increase!\n\nThis an example detailing how the payout structure is calculated. Exact cryptoback is subject to change.\nHow Can I Withdraw my earnings?\n\nYour earnings will appear in the same place as your cryptoback earnings. Minimal withdrawal size is 10 USD!\n\nSocial Trees Competition\n\nSoon, we will be announcing our Social Trees competition.

Our platform allows Web2 developers to seamlessly integrate P2P technology into their platforms without needing to know a Web3 coding language.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of app-chains, there have yet to be any to serve commerce-specific usecases. For brands to want to adopt Web3 technology, two major issues need to be solved - cost and user experience. Strata is dedicated to providing brands and consumers with unparalled user-experience, all at a fraction of the cost of general purpose L2s.\n\nWe also leverage Fractal (Solidity ‚Üí Move compiler), Movement‚Äôs decentralized sequencer network M1, and Avail DA.\n\nFeatures\nSecurity & Flexibility with Move and Solidity Runtimes\n\nWrite contracts in either Move, Solidity, or JavaScript and still leverage the security and performance of Move bytecode no matter the language you choose.\n\nNative Account Abstraction\n\nDeliver a web2 user experience with login abstraction, delegated transactions, and gas sponsorship.\n\nModular Design with Virtual Channels\n\nTrustlessly scale commerce applications with mint, burn, and trade tokens at a true zero cost through our proprietary virtual channels.\n\nBuilt for Speed & Affordability\n\nOur modular design lets you deploy and run your high-performance product at comparable costs with Web2 alternatives.\n\nPrevious\nLuxe Loyalty\nNext\nIntroduction\n\nLast updated 2 months ago\n\nIntroduction\nFeatures\nSecurity & Flexibility with Move and Solidity Runtimes\nNative Account Abstraction\nModular Design with Virtual Channels\nBuilt for Speed & Affordability"

We have instead adopted a hybrid structure where users can get both real cryptoback on the EVM chain of their choice (Base, Blast, Arbitrum, Optimism), and also $MOVE directly from their faucet. This requires you to have an EVM wallet AS WELL AS Razor Wallet or Nightly connected. We encourage you to connect both wallets as it helps us stress test Movement's network. Soon, we will release a DApp explorer, allowing you guys to navigate the Move ecosystem seamlessly with your earned faucet tokens.\n\n** ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTICE - For the time being, cryptoback will take roughly 30-45 days to deposit into your account. We are actively working to shorten this timeframe but are unable to solve this in the short-term.\n\nHow to Earn Cryptoback (Desktop)\n\nThere are two ways you can earn cryptoback through Luxe Rewards. The first is directly through our webapp, and second is through our chrome extension.\n\nWebapp - When you click the shops logo on the left-hand side navigation bar, a list of stores will pop up that you can earn cryptoback on.  Here, you can filter stores by region. We encourage you to leave the \"worldwide\" filter on, in addition to your native country, to ensure you are seeing as many stores as possible. Below is how the user flow works.\n\nChrome Extension - Simply go through your normal shopping process on any of the 2000+ stores we have, and our chrome extension will pop up when you shop!\n\nOnce you check out, funds will automatically be deposited into your balance. You can then withdraw them into your wallet once your balance hits 10 USD. PLEASE NOTE - At this time, we are only able to offer USDC or USDT as cryptoback. We will begin adding more cryptocurrencies in the future, starting with ETH and Solana.\n\nHow To Earn Cryptoback (On Mobile)\n\nVisit https://henry.social on your main mobile browser (chromium based browsers only)\n\nLog in through the toggle on the top right\n\nSearch for your favorite stores, go through your normal shopping process, and boom! Your rewards will appear in your account!\n\nThat's it! Go through your normal shopping process, check out, and your cryptoback will automatically be deposited!\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I shop with my earned crypto? - We do not have this functionality yet, but are actively working with providers to make this possible. Stay tuned for further updates!\n\nDoes using Luxe Rewards affect my credit card cashback? - The answer is no! Our platform operates totally independent of your credit card provider's cashback. That is the beauty of Henry Luxe Rewards. Everything is just bonus cashback.\n\n \n\nPrevious\nOnboarding Instructions\nNext\nHow To Earn Through Social Trees\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\nHow to Earn Cryptoback (Desktop)\nHow To Earn Cryptoback (On Mobile)\nFAQ"

Our dedicated rollup AppChain helps developers facilitate cost-free P2P transactions between brands and their customers with a fully Web3-abstracted development experience, shaping a future where blockchain technology will be mass adopted by brands.\n\nOur Vision\n\nHenry‚Äôs long-term vision is to build the infrastructure that powers the future of commerce.\n\nOur vision is two fold\n\nBring CommerceFi mainstream - With the vast majority of attention within the industry on DeFi and SocialFi, CommerceFi often gets swept under the rug. Yet, there are many usecases for blockchain technology for brands. We aim to bring more awareness to these possibilities and show brands whats possible when they push the boundaries of technological adoption.\n\nOnboard the next 1 billion users - The one thing all folks have in common (Web2 or Web3) is that everybody shops.
