Evm Wallet Binding\n2. Movement Aptos Wallet Binding\n3. Sui Movement Wallet Binding\n4. Binding Solutions\n5. Questions and issues:\nThe only guide you’ll need. Start from fresh, otherwise you can get lost…. Movement spans across multiple chains… the great news is, you can do it with as little as 1 wallet.\nI’ve made it detailed, but easy to follow… let’s begin.\n1. Evm Wallet Binding\n1️⃣\nEvm Wallet - Essential \nFortunately, the Movement focused wallets will both be adding EVM support, since Razor already has, we will use that… as it is testnet, you should probably use a burner wallet (a wallet specifically for this testnet).\nDo you already have an EVM bound to Galxe? Please see 1.\nStarting fresh on Galxe? See 2.\nAdding Razor as a secondary wallet → download Razor wallet and save your key phrase, switch network to MEVM then in Galxe → go to settings → go to wallet address → click the + button below your evm wallet →Next →Scroll down to Razor and BIND it!\nCreating a new Galxe with Razor as the Primary wallet → download Razor wallet and save your key phrase, switch network to MEVM then log into Galxe using the Razor wallet → click log in and scroll down to Razor.\nIf you prefer to use Metamask or another EVM wallet for the testnet you can add MEVM to your wallet and use it for the testnet. However, you will still need Razor in the next step.\nThe process is the same for all EVM wallets -> Go to settings -> Go to Networks -> Add network -> Input the following details:\nName -> MEVM\nRPC URL →Copy paste this → don’t click it https://mevm.devnet.imola.movementlabs.xyz/\nSymbol -> MOVE\nChain ID -> 30732\nBlock explorer URL → Copy paste this → don’t click it https://explorer.devnet.imola.movementlabs.xyz/\nSet to testnet\n2. Movement Aptos Wallet Binding \n2️⃣\nMovement Testnet Wallet - Essential (testnet address).\nAptos Move is the main TESTNETwork. It is actually called ‘Movement’ or ‘Testnet’. You’ll need a native movement wallet for this. There are 2 native wallets, Razor and Nightly. I recommend getting Razor first and then importing into nightly. Some apps need both!\nIf you already have Razor… skip to step 2!\nLet’s do this in 3 steps:\n1. Download Razor Wallet Click this word → Razor and create a new seed phrase and save it. Switch network to Movement Testnet.\n2. Connect Razor to Galxe by following the steps below -\n> Go to settings in your profile on galxe after logging in.\n> Go to Wallet Address and click Aptos… this will show Razor as an option! BIND IT.\n3. After binding Aptos Movement with Razor, you need to import your Razor wallet into Nightly. Follow this guide → https://x.com/ethicstweets/status/1818210897820594414\nGREAT, now your Nightly and Razor have the SAME address! This means you can use them interchangeably and, you have BINDed Razor to Galxe, so your Nightly wallet address is already on Galxe too!\nCannot Bind? See Binding Solutions\n3. Sui Movement Wallet Binding \n3️⃣\nSui Movement Wallet - Essential (devnet address, still needed for testnet).\nSui Move is still in devnet, however, some apps on the testnet will need it… It is called Sui Devnet, or Sui Move. The good news is, it is the same wallets as above! Razor and Nightly, you already have them now… now you need to bind Razor to Sui on Galxe.\nFollow the steps below…\n1. Switch network in Razor to Movement Sui → to manage extensions in your browser →go to details on razor wallet →scroll down and enable ‘allow in incognito’ →then open an incognito tab\n2. Go to Settings in Galxe.\n3. Go to Wallet Address.\n4. Go to Sui Network → Click Sui Wallet and Razor should pop up! \nCannot Bind? See Binding Solutions\n4. Binding Solutions\n4️⃣\nHere are two methods in order to successfully bind your wallets\nMethod A\nBind using incognito mode:\nGo to manage extensions\nGo to details on the wallet you are trying to bind\nScroll down and enable ‘allow in incognito’\nDo the same thing for Metamask\nOpen an incognito tab and log into Galxe using your preferred method\nBind again\nMethod B\nTemporarily disable other wallets: \nGo to manage extensions\nToggle off all wallets except Metamask and the wallet you need to bind.\nOpen an incognito window and open Galxe\nOpen Metamask, Navigate to \"Connected Sites\" & Disconnect\nClear your browser cookies & site data then refresh your browser.\nLogin with your primary EVM wallet\nAttempt binding your wallet again.\n5. Questions and issues:\n4️⃣\nQuestions and issues:\nWhy do we need so many BINDS?\nMovement is a huge ecosystem, with hundreds of apps and projects across a few chains.. so to verify all the testnet tasks, you’ll need to bind these wallets.\nMy address on Nightly is different to my Razor?\nRemove and import again, the method has been tested, if you follow the guide you will have the same address. Leave the settings on Default, do not change them unless instructed in the guide!\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING:\nThe most important thing is that your addresses on Galxe MATCH the ones you use on the apps for the quests.\nCANNOT BIND TO GALXE?\nIf you encounter issues binding to galxe, please make sure you have followed the steps closely. If it still doesn’t, ask in discord.\nASK IN DISCORD:\nIf you have followed closely and encounter an issue, please report it to a mod inside the Movement discord!"
