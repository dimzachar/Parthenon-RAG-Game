It provides a secure and innovative way to create, manage, register, and distribute prizes for various competitions.\n\n**[What makes BRKT unique?]**\nBRKT is the first on-chain decentralized protocol for managing competitions, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency. It leverages the INVKR Oracle to provide reliable data feeds and enhance the functionality of its smart contracts.\n\n**[What are the core components of BRKT?]**\nBRKT consists of two core smart contracts designed to handle different aspects of competition management:\n\n1. Competition Creation and Management Contract\n2. Participant Registration and Prize Distribution     \n     Contract\n\n**[How does the Competition Creation and Management Contract work?]**\nThis contract allows organizers to create and manage competitions on the blockchain. It includes features for setting up competition parameters, such as entry fees, rules, and deadlines. The contract ensures all details are immutable once the competition is created, maintaining transparency and fairness.\n\n**[How does the Participant Registration and Prize Distribution Contract work?]**\nThis contract handles the registration of participants and the distribution of prizes. It ensures that participants are correctly registered and that prizes are distributed automatically and fairly based on predefined rules and outcomes.\n\n**[What is the INVKR Oracle, and how does it integrate with BRKT?]**\nThe INVKR Oracle is an external data feed that provides reliable and tamper-proof data to the BRKT protocol. It integrates with the BRKT smart contracts to ensure accurate and secure information is used for competition outcomes, enhancing the reliability of the entire system.\n\n**[What types of competitions can be managed using BRKT?]**\nBRKT can manage a wide range of competitions, including but not limited to sports tournaments, e-sports, hackathons, and various online and offline contests. Its flexible design allows it to adapt to different competition formats and rules.\n\n**[How can I participate in a competition managed by BRKT?]**\nTo participate, you need to register through https://www.brkt.gg/competitions. Follow the instructions provided by the competition organizer, pay any required entry fees, and adhere to the competition rules.
