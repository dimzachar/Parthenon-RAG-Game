That‚Äôs why we have ‚ÄúGuilds‚Äù where you can use your specific skills and work closely with others who share similar interests. We‚Äôll be relaunching our Guilds for writers, creators, community hype beasts, devs and coders, social media gurus, and more over the next couple of weeks.\n\n\nEveryone will have a place in the Community. ‚ö°Ô∏è\n1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Pathfinders üß≠\nThe first Guild to relaunch is the Pathfinders! If you like to make new members feel comfy, answer members‚Äô questions, help plan and run games, build community, create educational material, and help with onboarding new users to Movement, then you will find a great home with the Pathfinders.\n2Ô∏è‚É£¬†Creators üé®\nThe next Guild is the Creators! These are the memers, the graphic designers, the NFT artists. If you like to decorate Discords, craft infographics, draw characters, create videos, and make the absolute dankest of memes, then you‚Äôll be a natural fit for the Creators. And promising artists may be selected to help with upcoming NFT projects‚Ä¶ \n3Ô∏è‚É£ Scholars üéì\nOur third Guild to relaunch is the Scholars!  Create threads, articles, and more about the Move language, Movement Labs, and our larger Ecosystem. And get them edited, hyped, and shared by the Community.\n4Ô∏è‚É£¬†Explorers üóª\nThe next Guild is the Explorers! This Guild is for those socialites of the group that like to hang on the socials, tweet, join in on our Spaces, gather frens into the Movement Community, hype Movement to other groups, and at higher levels even work on partnerships and collabs.\n5Ô∏è‚É£¬†Masons üõ†Ô∏è\nThe final Guild is the Masons! This Guild is for the builders and developers. Whether you‚Äôre an engineer in a major web3 project or curious about Move and want to learn more, this is your place. Deploying modules and apps, competing in coding and audit battles, and teaching others about Move and Movements infrastructure are just a few of the ways you can join in.\n6Ô∏è‚É£¬†Spartans ‚öîÔ∏è\nAnd now the Spartans, our on-chain warriors!\nHow To Participate In Building The Parthenon\nDuring Building The Parthenon, you can earn Resources by completing Quests on Building The Parthenon‚Äã\nThe Paths Of The Guilds\nBuilding The Parthenon FAQ\nHow The Community Program Works\n\n\nIn addition to the Building The Parthenon program, the Guild system reaches much further to form the foundation of our Community long-term. Each Guild will have multiple levels. Early levels are fairly easy to earn but later levels are for the truly dedicated Movers. \nYou can join as many Guilds as you want, but most members will find that they specialize and advance in one or two of them.\nProgram Perks\nWe want to encourage, equip, and reward members who participate in the program!\nHere are some examples of perks and benefits that you may receive as you level up:\nPriority Access: Be the first to try out new features and products from Movement Labs.\nOfficial Recognition: Receive shout-outs and mentions on Movement Labs‚Äô official social media channels.\nUnique Discord Roles: Stand out in the community with special roles that highlight your advancing Guild status.\nNFT Whitelist and Giveaways: As we partner with NFT projects, you can be eligible to get access to whitelists and NFT giveaways.\nFeatured Content: Have your work showcased on Movement Labs‚Äô Medium page and other official platforms.\nAccess to Exclusive Channels: Join private channels reserved for top contributors.\nCommunity Votes: Have a say in certain community decisions and initiatives.\nCollaboration Opportunities: Get the chance to collaborate with our internal content team on special projects.\nNetworking Opportunities: Connect with other ambassadors, Movement Labs team members, and industry experts.\nIncreased Visibility: Gain exposure to our global audience, increasing your own follower count and influence.\nProfessional Exposure: Gain visibility within the blockchain and crypto community, enhancing your personal brand as well as potential job opportunities within the ecosystem\nAnd there are more benefits we can‚Äôt even talk about yet! üòâ"
