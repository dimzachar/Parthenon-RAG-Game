This year, LNY falls on 2/10, and we will be entering the \ud83d\udc09 **Year of the Dragon** \ud83d\udc09.\n\nWhether or not you normally celebrate Lunar New Year, Seekers Alliance invites you to a fun LNY Bingo challenge! \n\n**The fastest Faction to complete 8\ufe0f\u20e3 (a lucky number in the Chinese culture because it sounds similar to \u201cfa\u201d, or \u201cfortune\u201d) lines \u2014 vertically, horizontally, or diagonally \u2014 wins the game.**\n\nThe winning Faction will be able to try out their luck in a raffle for \ud83e\udde7 **8 Seekers Alliance NFT Card Packs**! \ud83e\udde7 (Packs to be airdropped prior to game launch.)\n\nTeamwork is paramount! \ud83e\udd1c \ud83e\udd1b **Each category requires 9\ufe0f\u20e3 photo entries to complete. **\ud83d\udcf8  \n\nEach DiscordID can only upload one photo in each category.

If you've already done them, you will also be able to keep your Movement credit & points. \n\n(However, we do not recommend doing them going forward. \ud83d\ude4f)"
