The more trading volume is, the higher the prize pool is.\n\nCurrently, our monthly volume is around 5-6 Million(as of writing), and the initial prize pool is $3000. If during the campaign, the volume reaches higher, we‚Äôll distribute more rewards to eligible participants. \n\nThe details of your rewards.\n\nWe set the ‚ÄúPercentage Model‚Äù to deliver your rewards. For example, if you get 200 points, but in that Epoch, there‚Äôre a total of 20000 points, and the initial prize pool is $3000. Then:\n\nPoints Percentage: 200/20000*100%=1%\n\nReward: $3000*1%=$30\n\nSince the points vary, it‚Äôs better to keep an eye on it, making sure you‚Äôll get satisfactory rewards.\n\nAll the details are shown at the top of the page.\n\nCompensation Scheme\n\nHey, if you've been our omnifan for a while, you might have heard of or participated in our 'Gem Hunter' campaign. However, due to some changes in our business, we have decided to close it down. \n\nWe don't want your efforts to go to waste, so we've fully recorded your points and data and will soon come up with a compensation scheme that rewards you through our Referral Point System.\n\nPrevious\nTutorial\nNext\nIntroduction\n\nLast updated 12 months ago\n\nHow can I engage in it?\nHow about the prize pool?\nThe details of your rewards.\nCompensation Scheme"

Background\n\nPresently, a multitude of chains flourish simultaneously. Ethereum is the hub, housing over half of the total liquidity. The residual liquidity, however, is dispersed across various public chains.\n\nThe fragmentation of liquidity is clearly slowing asset turnover and making it harder for WEB3 users to manage their assets.\n\nThat‚Äôs why we need cross-chain, and then omnichain.\n\nAnd in this article, we‚Äôd love to introduce our OmniLending, the first one to connect and unify all the on-chain liquidity and support omnichain lending functions developed by our team.\n\nII. DOLA Protocol\n\nThe full name is ‚ÄúDecentralized Omnichain Liquidity Aggregation Protocol‚Äù\n\n(1) Star Topology Structure: Since the Sui network confirms instantly, which reduces cross-chain time, brings a better user experience, easier-to-expand on-chain storage resources, and safer move contract features.\n\nSo we using Sui as the settlement center and other single-coin pools on the chain as branch nodes in our protocol to support that.\n\n(2) Cross-chain of asset and message: Our protocol uses Layerzero, Wormhole, and other cross-chain message protocols to support cross-chain communication.\n\n(3) On-chain Governance: In the early stage, the protocol will be charged by the team, but after the token is released, the team will gradually transition the power to decentralized governance, and finally it will completely go to the community.\n\n(4) Extensible Application Plug-ins:\n\nDOLA Protocol can be used to develop all kinds of omnichain products, like:\n\nOmniID:omnichain digital identity, AA wallet entry\n\nOmniLending\n\nOmniSwap: Omnichain exchange\n\nOmni-Stablecoin\n\nOmniLSD: Omnichain liquidity mortgage derivatives\n\nIII. Omnilending\n\nIn this case, we regard Aave as a representative of lending protocols. It provides lending capabilities for a minority of tokens with better liquidity and satisfies the beneficial characteristics of no trust and no permission required.\n\nOver time, it is proved that Aave‚Äôs lending service model operates very well, indicating a high feasibility of this type of service market.\n\nSource: Defillama\n\nHowever, Aave only satisfies the lending of assets with good liquidity, and it is not very effective for other assets with poorer liquidity. Furthermore, Aave operates in a single-chain mode, which means its ecosystem is relatively narrow.\n\nDeployed on multiple chains\n\nIf one wants to deploy its protocol on other public chains, the costs would be high, and the operation would be more complex for users.\n\nTherefore, we believe that there are a lot of unmet needs in the current lending protocols, such as omnichain assets and a complete omnichain lending ecosystem, etc.\n\nWe launched our OmniLending based on the DOLA protocol to support:\n\n(1) Decentralized lending pool: Users provide idle liquidity to earn returns, and borrowers pledge liquidity to take out loans.\n\n(2) High asset utilization efficiency: Aggregate fragmented liquidity, enhancing the utilization of idle assets.\n\n(3) Convenient management of multi-chain assets: Users can deposit to the protocol on chain A to earn returns, and withdraw to claim returns on chain B.\n\nIV.OmniLending Protocol Security\n\nHere‚Äôre some mechanisms we used to ensure our Lending protocol‚Äôs security:\n\n(1) Over-collateralized: Every asset that is lent out corresponds to an over-collateralized asset, it‚Äôs the same as AAVE‚Äôs collateral ratio.\n\n(2) Two-stage floating lending rates: Low rates encourage borrowing when funds are abundant and high rates encourage debt repayment and increase additional liquidity when funds are scarce.\n\n(3) Risk Adjustment: Different from traditional lending protocol, we not only consider the risk of bad debts caused by the reduction of the value of the user‚Äôs collateral but also takes into account the risk of rising debt values.\n\n(4) Soft liquidation: In traditional lending, the liquidator‚Äôs one-off liquidation debt is fixed at 0.5(at present), which means the liquidator allows the liquidator to liquidate half of the debt at one time. The downside of this approach is that if smaller liquidations can restore debt to health, then liquidating half the debt is excessive and unfair.\n\nIn a soft liquidation model, no more debt is allowed to be liquidated at any one time than is needed to bring the defaulter back to normal (plus an additional Factor of safety). This means that less than half of the debt is liquidated by borrowers who default lightly and more than half of those who default heavily.\n\n(5) Anti-MEV Liquidation: In traditional lending, the incentive for liquidation is to offer the liquidator a fixed percentage discount on the borrower‚Äôs collateral, usually between 5% and 10%. Liquidators are profitable, but not MEV-resistant because miners can steal liquidators‚Äô trades.\n\nTo limit this kind of MEV, the agreement allows a liquidity provider to qualify for a discount (a liquidation discount based on the liquidity contributed by the liquidator to the agreement), with a low or no discount for miners and others.\n\n(6) Risk Margin: 20% interest on loans is used to pay off bad debts.\n\n(7) Liquidity Sequestration: Users can choose to participate only in savings and not in lending, thus avoiding the impact of the liquidation of the asset pool.\n\n(8) Joint Pricing: Combine decentralized Oracle and centralized exchange Price joint pricing.\n\n(9) Multi-channel cross-link bridges: To improve the fault tolerance of cross-link bridges.\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nOmniLending\nNext\nOracles\n\nLast updated 7 months ago\n\nI.

In a decentralized financial world, Aave offers the good features of no trust and no permission. While decentralized lending has proven to work well over time, there is a large unmet need for current lending protocols. \n\nHowever, Aave only meets the ability to lend to the most liquid assets and needs to be further extended for other assets because it's a single-chain model. Although cross-chain collateralized lending is achieved through a token bridge, it requires each public chain to deploy the Aave protocol, which is costly and complex for users to operate.\n\nInterest Rate Model\n\nReserves: In lending agreements, in rare cases the value of a borrower's collateral may be less than the value of its liabilities, in which case the borrower's ability to repay is referred to as insolvency. When an insolvent borrower is liquidated, there will be remaining liabilities that are considered to be bad debt. If bad debts appear to accumulate, lenders may all come at once to withdraw funds to avoid becoming a bad debtor. \n\nTo mitigate this risk, follow Compound's practice of agreeing to draw down a portion of the interest accumulated into a reserve. If bad debts arise and the reserve is used to make repayments, the lender can avoid becoming the bearer of bad debts as long as the reserve accumulates faster than the bad debts. The percentage of interest withdrawn to become a reserve is called the reserve factor and is noted as RF. Different assets have different RF. The RF takes on a value between 0 and 1 and can be adjusted for trade-offs through governance.\n\nPrevious\nTutorial\nNext\nWhy OmniLending?\n\nLast updated 7 months ago"
