This degenSUI is distributed among users participating in protocol governance. DeFi primitives are accessible at https://defi.degenhive.ai/"

Whitelist validators for staking SUI via the protocol's liquid staking layer.\n3. Update HIVE emissions across supported AMM pools.\n4. Access HIVE and BEE tokens within the protocol treasury.\n5.
